# Your Project's Name: Fishy Business

The Fishy Business website was made for fishing enthusiasts of any experience level. It allows people to buy, learn, and use the latest fishing equipment. It features a variety of products, from the newest tools such as telescopic fishing rods and smart lures to basic items like braided fishing lines. The website offers high-quality fishing equipment designed to enhance the overall experience for any fisherman. 
 
## Design Process
 
Since the website focuses on selling high-quality fishing equipment, I decided to design the logo and banner to reflect that theme. I incorporated a fish with a fishing line extending from it to emphasize the fishing aspect. The website's color scheme features dark green, reminiscent of the deep waters where fish thrive. This choice was made because the primary target audience consists of fishermen and fishing enthusiasts; Fishy Business aims to provide them with top-notch fishing gear.

The website offers a convenient way for customers to access the equipment they need while also showcasing the latest products available in the market through the shop page. Additionally, it provides educational resources and recommendations on how to use the equipment effectively and what types of gear are suitable for different fish species via the FAQ page.

User Stories:
. As a beginner fishing enthusiast, I want to explore a variety of products so that I can find the right gear to start fishing.
. As an experienced angler, I want detailed product descriptions and specifications so that I can compare and choose the best items for my needs.
. As a busy customer, I want a fast and easy checkout process so that I can purchase my gear without unnecessary delays.
. As a potential customer, I want to contact the store for inquiries to clarify product details or shipping policies.
. As a loyal user, I want to follow the brand on social media to stay updated on promotions, new arrivals, and community events.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
